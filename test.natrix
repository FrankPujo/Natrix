^ sample natrix scripts;
^ always end lines (including comments!) with a semicolon: ;
^ also: leave a space after the ^ symbol for comments;
^ this way making multi-line comments is very easy:
done!
and now we can end it;

^ declaring a variable:;
loc number = 3 + 2;
loc string = "wow, really cool!";

^ you can print both simple strings and variables;
print "something";
print string;
print number;

loc i = 1;
^ right now it's impossible to assign a variable the value of another variable compared;
loc test = i + number;
print test;

loc numb = 2;
loc obj = numb * 6;
print obj;

loop i for 3;
	loc thingInLoop = 2
